need a python application that uses facebook prophet to predict fuel prices given a csv file.
The csv file will have 2 columns, first would be date in ISO format and the 2nd would be price.
The date column will represent 1st of every month since 2019.
need dummy records to put in the csv files for 5 years, the price would be in PKR. Price was 120 in 2019 and now in May 2025 its 240.
Prophet can take this date and price column into consideration and should make a prediction for next 5 months and also save the prediction along with the graphs png in the project directory.
